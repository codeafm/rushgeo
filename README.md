Welcome to Geo Rush (“App”). Your privacy matters to us. This Policy explains what data we (CODEAFM) collect, how we use it, and your choices.

Device & Usage Data (non-personal): Device model, OS version, language, country/region (coarse), in-game events, session length, crash logs, performance metrics.

Advertising Identifiers: If ads are enabled, ad partners may use the device’s advertising ID (e.g., Google/Android Advertising ID) to show relevant ads.

3) Data Sharing

We do not sell your personal data. We may share aggregated, non-personal statistics with:

Ad networks/mediation (e.g., Google/Unity/Yandex Ads, if used)
These partners process data under their own privacy policies.

The App may request limited permissions necessary for gameplay, analytics, or ads (e.g., internet access, network state). We do not request access to contacts, SMS, microphone, or precise location.

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

7) Third-Party Services

The App may include the following (as applicable):

Google Play Services

Advertising networks (e.g., Google/Unity/Yandex Ads)

Analytics (e.g., Firebase Analytics / Crashlytics)
Each has its own privacy policy. Please review their documents for details on their processing and opt-out options (e.g., device advertising settings).

8) Your Choices

Advertising ID controls: You can reset or limit ad tracking in your device settings.

Opt-out of analytics (where supported): Some SDKs allow limiting data collection in settings.
